          When I was in Japan, I went to a Tsukemen (dipping ramen) restaurant. Ramen restaurants in Japan sometimes have vending machines where you place your orders.
          I was quite hungry so I ordered extra noodles on top of my order. I then brought it to the ramen bar to place my order
          with the chef. He asked me what size I wanted with my order and I instantly said large (750g) with no hesitation. I took a second to process my order and realized I
          ordered a large ramen with extra noodles which ended up being about 1kg (2.2 lbs). Wasting food was not an option so I painstackingly ate every last noodle (with some help
          from my friends).

          This is a video that showcases how Tsukemen is eaten at one of the best Tsukemen restaurants in the world. However, the dipping sauce is very flavorful so it is advised
          not to dunk your noodles like seen in the video.

          I have always loved food. While I am not creative enough to come up with my own original recipes, I am able to follow recipes to pick up some cooking skills.
          Recently, I learned how to make jajangmyeon (noodles in black bean sauce). The sauce is extremely savory and can be served with thinly sliced cucumbers over chewy noodles.
